Description: A comprehensive framework for experimental design and power analysis 
    in genotype-environment association (GEA) studies, with specialized support
    for holobiont systems (host-microbiome-environment interactions). Simulates 
    realistic population genetic data using coalescent theory via 'coala', 
    environmental gradients, and holobiont responses (microbiome abundance, 
    diversity, composition, or host phenotypes) to determine required sample 
    sizes for detecting genotype-environment associations. Provides comprehensive
    diagnostic tools for assessing data quality, including tests for 
    genotype-environment independence, population structure confounding, 
    signal-to-noise ratios, linkage disequilibrium patterns, and environmental 
    gradient quality. Supports multiple population structures (panmictic, 
    isolation-by-distance, discrete populations), demographic histories 
    (bottlenecks, expansions), and genotype-by-environment interactions. 
    Implements GEA methods including RDA (Redundancy Analysis) with support 
    for LFMM (Latent Factor Mixed Models). Designed for forest tree holobiont 
    research studying adaptation and acclimation across environmental gradients,
    developed by the PhytOakmeter research unit.

Description: 
    phytometr provides a unified framework for simulating environmental gradients, 
    host systems (clonal or genetically structured), and holobiont responses such as 
    microbiome diversity, composition, or abundance. The package enables statistically 
    grounded power analysis for experimental design in both field gradients and controlled 
    experiments. Users can model how much environmental variation, replication, and sample 
    size are required to detect environmental effects, host effects, or interactions 
    on holobiont components. 
    The framework supports: (1) clonal systems where host genetic variation is negligible, 
    (2) natural populations with user-defined host genetic structure, and 
    (3) flexible literature-based parameterization of holobiont response sensitivity to 
    environmental drivers. 
    A second development phase will extend the framework to full genotype–environment 
    association (GEA) simulations using coalescent-based host genetic data.

\usage{
define_host_model(
  type = c("clone", "natural"),
  pop_structure = c("panmictic", "discrete", "isolation_by_distance"),
  Ne = 1e+05,
  mutation_rate = 1,
  recombination_rate = 0,
  migration_rate = 0.01,
  fst = NULL,
  var_host = 0,
  notes = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{type}{Character. Either:
\itemize{
\item \code{"clone"}: clonal system; effectively one genotype,
all individuals genetically identical for our purposes.
\item \code{"natural"}: natural population, genotypes simulated
with a coalescent model via \pkg{coala}.
}}

\item{pop_structure}{Character (for \code{type = "natural"}). High-level
description of population structure, currently one of:
\itemize{
\item \code{"panmictic"}: single well-mixed population.
\item \code{"discrete"}: (reserved for future use, not yet implemented).
\item \code{"isolation_by_distance"}: (reserved for future use).
}
At the moment, only \code{"panmictic"} is implemented for the
coalescent simulation; other structures will give an error to
avoid pretending it works.}

\item{Ne}{Numeric. Effective population size. Stored mainly for
documentation; coalescent scaling is currently driven by
\code{mutation_rate} and \code{recombination_rate}.}

\item{mutation_rate}{Numeric. Mutation rate parameter passed to
\pkg{coala} (often denoted \eqn{\theta}). Adjust based on expected
SNP density.}

\item{recombination_rate}{Numeric. Recombination rate parameter
for \pkg{coala}. Set to 0 to ignore recombination.}

\item{migration_rate}{Numeric. Placeholder for future structured
models. Currently not used for \code{"panmictic"}.}

\item{fst}{Optional numeric. Target Fst between populations. Stored
as metadata for now; the mapping from Fst to coalescent parameters
can be implemented later.}

\item{var_host}{Numeric in between 0 and 1. Proportion of variance in the
holobiont/phenotypic response that is expected to be explained
by host genotype (based on literature or pilot data). This is
used later when you simulate the holobiont response.}

\item{notes}{Optional character string for free-text comments
(e.g. literature references, assumptions about Ne or Fst).}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{"host_model"} with elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{type}: "clone" or "natural".
\item \code{pop_structure}: population structure (if natural).
\item \code{Ne}, \code{mutation_rate}, \code{recombination_rate},
\code{migration_rate}, \code{fst}: coalescent parameters.
\item \code{var_host}: expected variance proportion explained by host.
\item \code{notes}: user comments.
}
}
\description{
This function specifies how host genotypes should be simulated:
either as a clonal system (no or negligible genotypic variation),
or as a natural population simulated under a coalescent model
using the \pkg{coala} package.
}
\details{
It does \strong{not} generate any genotypes yet. Instead, it stores
the assumptions and parameters needed to simulate host SNP data
later, when a specific sample size (number of individuals and
loci) is chosen.

# 1) Clone system: one genotype, no host variance
host_clone <- define_host_model(
  type     = "clone",
  var_host = 0,
  notes    = "Clonal oak line; host variance assumed negligible."
)

# 2) Natural panmictic population: coalescent host
host_nat <- define_host_model(
  type              = "natural",

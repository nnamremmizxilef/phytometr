\usage{
define_env_locations(
  locations,
  context = c("field", "controlled"),
  within_group_sd = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{locations}{A data frame with one row per site/condition.
Must contain either a column \code{group_id} or any of
\code{location}, \code{site}, \code{condition}. All other \strong{numeric} columns are
treated as environmental variables (e.g. temperature, moisture).}

\item{context}{Character, \code{"field"} or \code{"controlled"}.
Only used as a label in the resulting object.}

\item{within_group_sd}{Either
\itemize{
\item a single numeric (same SD for all env variables), or
\item a named numeric vector with one SD per variable
(names must match the \emph{numeric} environmental variables).
}}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{env_space}, with slots
\code{context}, \code{n_groups}, \code{variables}, \code{planned},
\code{realised}, and \code{within_group_sd}.
}
\description{
This is for the case where you already know which sites or
experimental conditions are available (e.g. field sites, growth chambers)
and their typical environmental values.
}
\details{
The function converts those into an \code{env_space} object that can be
used by the rest of the phytometr workflow.

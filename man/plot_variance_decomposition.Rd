\title{Plot variance decomposition for holobiont components}
\usage{
plot_variance_decomposition(power_results, components, var_host = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{power_results}{A data frame returned by
\code{simulate_holobiont_power()}. Only used for its component names
(the power values themselves are not directly used here).}

\item{components}{The component specification list used for simulation
(the same object you pass to \code{simulate_holobiont_components()}).
Each component must have an element \code{r2_env}.}

\item{var_host}{Numeric scalar giving the fraction of variance you want
to attribute to host effects (default 0 for clone systems).}
}
\value{
A stacked barplot (ggplot object) showing variance fractions
for environment, host, and residual per component.
}
\description{
This is a conceptual diagnostic: given the R² you specified for
environment–component relationships, it shows how much variance is
attributed to environment, host, and residual noise for each component.
}
\details{
In the current Phase 1 implementation, host variance is not yet simulated,
so the default is \code{var_host = 0}. You can change this to explore
"what-if" scenarios (e.g. \code{var_host = 0.2}).
